        Hi! I'm Julian. I'm currently a fourth-year software engineering student
        at Macquarie University. I'm also an aspiring full-stack developer.

      <p>
        I've always been passionate about technology, which is why I decided to
        start studying sofware engineering in 2017. Since then, I've learned a
        lot and hope to keep learning as opportunities present themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created this website for you to view some of my personal projects and
        read a bit about myself. View away!
